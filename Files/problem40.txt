Given alinked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem withoutmodifying the values in the lists nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in thelistis in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100
